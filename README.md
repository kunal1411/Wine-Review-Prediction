# Wine-Review-Prediction

Objective

We analyzed Wine Review dataset from Kaggles.com to extract meaningful marketing insights from it to help online wine platform startup to navigate in the complicated market. We utilized ggplot library to create intuitive and informative visualizations to help identifying pattern and relationship between wine variables and reviewed scores. We further utilized linear regression analysis to further investigate the relationship we identified, and kept optimizing the model with feature engineering and natural language processing techniques. With the accurate model we trained, our client can not only determine popularity or quality of each product, but also predict scores when it is not available to provide customers with helpful information.
